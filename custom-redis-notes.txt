--What is Redis?
Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an in-memory key-value database that provides ultra-fast data access.
It stores data in RAM, making it much faster than traditional databases that rely on disk storage.

--Redis Communication & Protocol
Redis runs on its default port 6379 where it listens for client requests.
Communication between clients and the Redis server happens over the TCP protocol.
Redis enforces communication through Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP), ensuring that all commands are properly structured.


--How Redis Works?
Clients send commands (like SET key value or GET key) to the Redis server.
The server parses these commands and performs operations in memory.
Responses are sent back in a specific format defined by RESP.
